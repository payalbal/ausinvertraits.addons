      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog

      mycetophagous, myrmecophylous, xylophagous) by referring to data used in previous work at the Wog Wog Fragmentation 
      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection. 
      Our resulting collection consists of species and morphospecies (all hereafter referred to as species). Our 
      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the 
      transects at 0 m (on the edge of the forest and road or firebreak), 10, 31.6, 100, 316 and 1000 m into the 
      Eucalyptus forest and 0, 10, 31.6, 100 and 316 m into the pine forest. We excluded sampling points in gullies and 
      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.

      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in

      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to

      mycetophagous, myrmecophylous, xylophagous) by referring to data used in previous work at the Wog Wog Fragmentation 
      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection. 
      Our resulting collection consists of species and morphospecies (all hereafter referred to as species). Our 
      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the 
      transects at 0 m (on the edge of the forest and road or firebreak), 10, 31.6, 100, 316 and 1000 m into the 
      Eucalyptus forest and 0, 10, 31.6, 100 and 316 m into the pine forest. We excluded sampling points in gullies and 
      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.

      mycetophagous, myrmecophylous, xylophagous) by referring to data used in previous work at the Wog Wog Fragmentation 
      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection. 
      Our resulting collection consists of species and morphospecies (all hereafter referred to as species). Our 
      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the 
      transects at 0 m (on the edge of the forest and road or firebreak), 10, 31.6, 100, 316 and 1000 m into the 
      Eucalyptus forest and 0, 10, 31.6, 100 and 316 m into the pine forest. We excluded sampling points in gullies and 
      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.

      mycetophagous, myrmecophylous, xylophagous) by referring to data used in previous work at the Wog Wog Fragmentation 
      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection.

      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the 
      transects at 0 m (on the edge of the forest and road or firebreak), 10, 31.6, 100, 316 and 1000 m into the

      whether they had functional wings according to other similar species in the same genus. Beetles were sampled
      along trasects using pitfall traps. At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection. 
      Our resulting collection consists of species and morphospecies (all hereafter referred to as species). Our 
      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the

      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.

      Experiment (Margules 1992; Davies et al. 2000) for the same species in the same area. For species that we were not 
      able to match to the Wog Wog beetle collection, we assigned them to a feeding-guild according to other similar species 
      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps. 
      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in

      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to

      in the same genus that had already been assigned a feeding guild. Beetles were sampled along trasects using pitfall traps.

      At each sampling point, two pitfall traps, each consisting of a cup 90 mm 
      in diameter and 100 mm deep, a 600 mm x 50 mm high fence and a 200 mm x 200 mm roof, were placed 3 m a part in 
      a randomised direction. Pitfall traps containing pitfall fixative (94% ethanol, 5% glycol, 1% distilled water) 
      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and 
      gave new codes to those morphospecies that we were not able to identify by reference to CSIRO Wog Wog collection. 
      Our resulting collection consists of species and morphospecies (all hereafter referred to as species). Our 
      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine 
      plantation edge. The edge between the Eucalyptus and pine forests is intersected by a dirt road of about 10 m in 
      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the 
      transects at 0 m (on the edge of the forest and road or firebreak), 10, 31.6, 100, 316 and 1000 m into the

      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.

      were left open for 1 week in February 2011. The two pitfall trap catches at each sampling point were pooled to 
      create one sample per sampling point. Beetles from each sample were sorted to species level. We used the Wog Wog 
      beetle reference collection stored at the Australian National Insect Collection at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences in 
      Canberra, Australia, to help in the identification of some species. The CSIRO collection consists of morphospecies, 
      many of which are identified to species, each with a unique voucher code. We retained these codes in our data and

      experimental design consisted of three blocks of up to seven transects spanning the native Eucalyptus forest–pine

      width and (in one block) a cleared fire break of about 100 m in width. Sampling points were located along the

      Eucalyptus forest and 0, 10, 31.6, 100 and 316 m into the pine forest. We excluded sampling points in gullies and 
      ridge tops. As a result of this, many transects did not have the full complement of sampling points at all distances.
