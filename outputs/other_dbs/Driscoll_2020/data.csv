Transect sites consisted of 11 pairs of 20 litre pitfall traps, each pair connected by a 20 m drift fence. Trap pairs were spaced along the 400 m transect at 40 m intervals. Grid sites included a 5 × 10 arrangement of individual 20 litre pitfall traps, each with a 10 m drift fence, with traps spaced at 25 m intervals. The grids and transects were placed in 15 areas that were burnt by different fires in five different locations. We surveyed beetles over four consecutive summers from December 2004-February 2005 (referred to as 2004) to December 2007-February 2008 (referred to as 2007). In each summer, we conducted three six-night sampling periods approximately monthly, except in the second summer when we sampled in two periods (December and February). Sites were sampled for an average of 15.4 (SD = 4.0) nights per year and we accommodated unequal sampling in the analyses. Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data.

Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler). Beetles < 6mm long could not be reliably collected from 20 litre pitfall traps in a time-efficient manner and were excluded from analysis, and we excluded species with fewer than five records as they were inadequate for analysis.

Sites were sampled for an average of 15.4 (SD = 4.0) nights per year and we accommodated unequal sampling in the analyses. Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler).

Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler).

Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data.

Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler).

Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens.

Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler).

Sites were sampled for an average of 15.4 (SD = 4.0) nights per year and we accommodated unequal sampling in the analyses. Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler). Beetles < 6mm long could not be reliably collected from 20 litre pitfall traps in a time-efficient manner and were excluded from analysis, and we excluded species with fewer than five records as they were inadequate for analysis.

Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler). Beetles < 6mm long could not be reliably collected from 20 litre pitfall traps in a time-efficient manner and were excluded from analysis, and we excluded species with fewer than five records as they were inadequate for analysis.

Transect sites consisted of 11 pairs of 20 litre pitfall traps, each pair connected by a 20 m drift fence. Trap pairs were spaced along the 400 m transect at 40 m intervals. Grid sites included a 5 × 10 arrangement of individual 20 litre pitfall traps, each with a 10 m drift fence, with traps spaced at 25 m intervals. The grids and transects were placed in 15 areas that were burnt by different fires in five different locations. We surveyed beetles over four consecutive summers from December 2004-February 2005 (referred to as 2004) to December 2007-February 2008 (referred to as 2007). In each summer, we conducted three six-night sampling periods approximately monthly, except in the second summer when we sampled in two periods (December and February). Sites were sampled for an average of 15.4 (SD = 4.0) nights per year and we accommodated unequal sampling in the analyses. Data from February 2006 at Pinkawillinie were excluded from year 2 due to a fire in December 2005 which changed the time since fire during the sampling year. Post-fire data from Hincks in December 2006 were excluded because inflated capture rates immediately after fire give a misleading impression of high abundance. Beetles were identified to species or morphospecies level using a photographic guide to common beetles that we prepared based on initial trapping, alongside a field-box of pinned specimens. Species that were unambiguously identified were marked with a paint spot on the ventral surface and released 5-10 m from the point of capture. Recaptured animals were excluded from the data. Individuals that could not be identified in the field were assigned a morphospecies name, and were preserved for later identification at the South Australian Museum (Eric Matthews) or CSIRO Entomology (Tom Weir, Rolf Oberprieler). Beetles < 6mm long could not be reliably collected from 20 litre pitfall traps in a time-efficient manner and were excluded from analysis, and we excluded species with fewer than five records as they were inadequate for analysis.
